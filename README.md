# Project_Diabetes

Diabetes mellitus (sometimes called "sugar diabetes") is a condition that occurs when the body can't use glucose (a type of sugar) normally. The objective of the dataset is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. For project purpose, five different machine learning classification algorithms are applied on the dataset to predict disease status of patient. Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is compared. These results are also verified using ROC curves.
